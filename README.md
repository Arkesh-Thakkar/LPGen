# LpGen
It is an automated invariant generation tool based on Linaer Regression and Linear Programming.

It has been tested on 3 SVCOMP benchmarks namely NLA-digbench, loop-zilu, loop-invvariants.

Benchmark folder contains the csv that captured the value of variables of the program at the loop head during different loop iterations.

# Note:
- CSV are manually generated by supplying random set of inputs to the program that satisfy pre condition and values of the variables are captured.
- To infer invariant for any other program other than benchmarks, above step needs to be done and csv with values of variables needs to be generated.
- Ideal number of the samples would be 20x the number of variables (i.e., original + non-linear generated)

# To run benchmarks following are the steps.

--> Clone the repo
--> Go to the path of LpGen.py
--> Run the following command
      python LpGen.py -b="Name of Benchmark: nla/zilu/loop-inv"

# To run on own csv files perform following steps:

--> Clone the Repo
--> Go to the path of LpGen.py
--> Run the following command
    python LpGen.py -p="Path to your csv file" -fn="filename" -pre="pre conditon as per pyz3 format ex And(x>=y)" -ind="Inductive conditon as per pyz3 format ex And(x>=y)"
    -post="post conditon as per pyz3 format ex And(x>=y)" -lc="loop conditon as per pyz3 format ex And(x>=y). If undeterministic write unknown" -degree="Degree in int to check upto n degree polynomial"
